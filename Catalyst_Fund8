Crowdfunding platform do not provide a in-built system assuring that proposed performance matches expectations and preventing no-delivery/no-payment cybercrime
Problem solution 
Athena, a Cardano Blockchain DeFi ecosystem based crowdfunding platform with in-built KPI (Key Performance Index) through mediation/conflict resolution functionality and participants credibility assessment algorithm to enhance all participants reliability

What is Athena
Athena is a crowdfunding platform with in-built mediation functionality. Any registered member can propose or support a project and also candidate to become a juror for mediation cases in other projects.
How does it work?
Athena aims to overcome the limits of physical contracts by providing a platform that enables parties to create contracts stored in the Cardano blockchain. The platform builds members trust based on token rewards and penalties, supported by a Credit Assessment System (CAS) able to address every platform member.
The reward-penalty system is an algorithm that collects statistics related to the service transactions, user reviews, and other activities. It returns the amount of tokens that will be rewarded. Parties that refuse to follow the rules defined in the contract will be penalized by losing tokens proportionate to the severity of their violation. In extreme cases membership access to the platform will be suspended.
In such a case all member's account own assets, such as ADA and DSET (the utility token) are burnt. Members can register upon going through KYC process with little access fees to prevent abuses.
By integrating real-world reliable inputs with strict on-chain contracts, Athena mitigates the ambiguity common in natural-language written contracts, while preserving the flexibility needed to communicate with the real world.
Trust among mediators, service providers, and clients will be measured by a review system that is powered by DSET tokens which represent a "trust score". This system, when combined with other components, will be used to determine a user's periodical reward.
When signing into the platform members receive a reliability score of 60 (max is 100), called CAS (Credit Assessment Score). Based on activities on the platform an algorithm will periodically and dynamically update CAS values. CAS represents a key attribute associated with each member and displays the reliability of the member in the past. It has also an ethical value in preventing misbehaviors and driving commitment.
Mediators are rewarded for their activity in the specialized sector
Crowdfunding features  - Campaign Proposer set: 
    1. Project description
    2. Measurable performance items (KPI)
    3. Collaterals tokens (ADA): showing the commitment in delivering according to KPI 
    4. Value Target to achieve to make the campaign successful
    5. Minimum single subscriber figure
    6. Campaign start and end
    7. Date of delivery if campaign is successful
    8. Requesting the stepwise receipt of total pledged amount
    9. Selection of mediator from available list 
Athena DApp Core Components
Athena identifies two core components to provide a in-built mediation crowdfunding platform that is affordable, fast, fair, and provides a great user experience:
A. Ease of Use
Users should be able to create Smart Contracts in a few clicks using an advanced interactive drag and drop editor. Contract templates will provide an easy way to offer and subscribe services. Visual training will be provided on the platform as well as on main social to widespread blockchain wallet management and platform functionality. 
B. Competitive fees
Crowdfunding related fees will be as low as one third compared with presently existing crowdfunding platform. This is achieved by low payment transfer fees thanks to Cardano transaction fees level and due to highly automated process integrated into the platform.
 Everyone will have access to contract templates to launch and subscribe a campaign. A one-time small entrance fee is required mainly to prevent membership spam attacks.


Hereafter the main crowdfunding platform features at 1. Development Stage:
    • Two tokens will be minted and provided to students of the selected pilot high school: GR (GRADES ) and SU (SUPPORTS)
    • Each student registered on Athena receives  1,000 GR and 10,000 SU
    • GR are used as collateral: the project proposer commits an arbitrary amount to show how committed he/she is to the project performance.
    • SU are used to show support of other projects
    • A higher amount of grades committed will mean also that the student will receive a higher evaluation if the project is fully executed as for smart contract
    • A higher SU provided by other students will mean a higher acknowledgement and evaluation for those who supported a successful project. If the project fails, or succeed only partially, SU are lost or provide only a little contribution to those students who put them.
Example
-Alice loves Maths and proposes building a cool website as project. This contains maths tools and resources to help students understand what is being taught at school. Accordingly she states some measurable and identifiable performance metrics.
-Bob, Charlie and 7 other students like Alice's idea and allocate some of their SU tokens to contribute to Alice's project. Upon successful project execution, Alice's grade is calculated through a formula weighting both committed GR and SU tokens.
Awarding the full tokens set requires Alice to request it and trigger the smart-contract in-built 'mediation/conflict-resolution'. The selected mediator will be called in to check all performance items that Alice set in her project. Upon this check the tokens are released.  If any item fails the students who provided support SU will vote to decide the project percentage achievement. The project result affects also the CAS value of Alice as well as those who supported the project.

Cardano Community benefits
-large users base aiming at increasing utility and adoption of Cardano
-enabling high school students creativity development through Cardano
-dynamic credit score associated with each member: this will represent a major improvement to  achieve trust through technology to prevent no delivery/no payment cyber-crime issues
-access to all participants to become jurors of a specific category and being rewarded for the activity
-far lower fees vs presently existing crowdfunding platforms
